                <h1>Hi, I'm Henry.</h1>
                <p>An aspiring web developer from Sydney.</p>
            </hgroup>
            <p>I'm a senior business analyst, with a love for clean code and beautiful design. I've worked at
                market-leading companies; designing and implementing web and script automation solutions that have saved
                thousands of hours of manual work. Through this, I discovered my passion in both simple, beautiful user
                experiences, and bringing them to life with code.</p>
